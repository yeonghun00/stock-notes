Dear Mr. Park,

I hope you're doing well.

My name is Evan (Yeonghun), and I’m currently a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking at HSBC Hong Kong. With around 20 days left in my internship, I’m reaching out to explore different areas of the bank and better understand how they contribute to HSBC’s broader strategy.

Your work in Global Research, especially within the industrial, chemical, and oil sectors, really stood out to me. I come from a data analytics background, and I’m particularly interested in how data and macro/sector research inform decision-making across the bank.

I understand you must have a very busy schedule, but if you’re open to a brief 15-minute conversation — either in person or virtually — I’d sincerely appreciate the opportunity. I’m based in the same building in Hong Kong and completely flexible on timing.

If your schedule is packed, I’d also be grateful for any recommendations of colleagues I might reach out to.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Evan (Yeonghun)
Data Analytics Intern
Commercial Banking, HSBC Hong Kong



Dear Mr. Kim,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Evan (Yeonghun), a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking, with about 20 days remaining in my internship.

I’m eager to learn more about Financial Markets before I finish, and your role in Equity Derivatives stood out to me — especially as someone interested in how data supports decision-making in a fast-paced trading environment.

I completely understand you must be very busy, but if you're open to it, I’d be very grateful for a brief 15-minute conversation, either in person or virtually. I’m based in the same building in Hong Kong and flexible with timing.

If your schedule doesn’t allow, I’d also appreciate any recommendations of colleagues I could reach out to. I'm also happy to chat in Korean, if that’s more comfortable.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Evan (Yeonghun)

Dear Ms. Moon,

I hope you're doing well.

My name is Evan (Yeonghun), a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking. I have about 20 days left in my internship, and before I finish, I’m hoping to gain a broader understanding of how different areas of HSBC operate.

Your role in Collateral Treasury caught my attention, especially given my interest in how financial resources and risks are managed within the bank.

I completely understand you have a busy schedule, but if you’re open to it, I’d be truly grateful for a brief 15-minute conversation — in person or virtual, whichever is more convenient for you. I’m based in the same building in Hong Kong and flexible with timing.

If your schedule is full, I’d also really appreciate any recommendation of colleagues who might be open to a quick chat.

Thank you so much for considering this.

Best regards,
Evan (Yeonghun)
