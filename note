✅ To Selina Moon (Polite Version):
Subject (optional): Quick Chat Before Internship Ends

Hi Selina,

I’m Evan (Yeonghun), a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking. I have about 20 days left in my internship, and before I wrap up, I’m hoping to learn more about different areas of the bank.

Your role in Collateral Treasury really stood out to me, especially given my interest in how financial resources and risks are managed at HSBC.

I know you must be very busy, but if you're open to it, I’d be truly grateful for the opportunity to have a brief 15-minute chat — either in person or virtually, whichever is more convenient for you. I’m based in the same building in Hong Kong and very flexible with timing.

If your schedule is tight, I completely understand — and if possible, I’d also appreciate any recommendations for others I might speak with.

Thank you so much for considering this,

Evan (Yeonghun)
Data Analytics Intern

Subject (optional): Interest in Trading – Quick Chat?

Hi Tae Youl,

I’m Evan (Yeonghun), currently interning in Commercial Banking as a Data Analytics Intern. With about 20 days left in my internship, I’m hoping to gain a broader understanding of different areas across HSBC — especially in the financial markets.

Your role in Equity Derivatives caught my attention, as I’m very interested in how data and analytics are applied to support trading decisions in such a dynamic environment.

I know you must have a very full schedule, but if you're open to it, I’d sincerely appreciate a brief 15-minute chat — in person or virtual, whichever you prefer. I'm in the same building and completely flexible on timing.

Also, if you’re more comfortable speaking in Korean, I’d be happy to use Korean. And if your calendar is packed, I would be grateful if you could recommend someone else I might speak with.

Thank you again for your time and consideration,

Evan (Yeonghun)
Data Analytics Intern





✅ 1. Do Your Homework (15–30 min)
Before the meeting:

Google/LinkedIn/HSBC internal profiles: Read their background.

Know what their team does (e.g. Collateral Treasury = managing risk & liquidity with assets).

Think: How does their job connect to your interests (data, finance, risk)?

Bring 2–3 questions (write them down). Examples:

“What does a typical day look like in your role?”

“What skills are most important in your team?”

“How do you see data analytics impacting your area in the future?”

“If you were starting out now, what would you focus on learning?”

✅ 2. Prepare Your Intro (30 seconds)
You'll need a quick self-intro:

“Hi, I’m Evan (Yeonghun), intern in Data Analytics under Commercial Banking. I’ve been working on [briefly mention your project if any], and I’m really curious about how other teams work—especially yours.”

Practice it once or twice before. Keep it natural.

✅ 3. During the Meeting
Be on time (arrive 2–3 min early if in person).

Smile and be polite, even if you're nervous.

Be genuinely curious, not trying to impress.

Ask your questions — but also let them talk freely.

Take quick notes (on phone or notebook — just jot key points).

If they seem warm, you can also ask:

“Do you enjoy the role?”

“What kind of people succeed in your team?”

“Do you think this area fits someone from a data background?”

✅ 4. At the End
Thank them genuinely:

“Thanks so much for your time — this really helped me understand more about [topic]. I really appreciate it.”

Ask if it’s okay to stay in touch (especially if they were helpful):

“Would it be alright if I reach out again in the future with any questions?”

✅ 5. After the Meeting
Send a follow-up thank you message on Teams or email (same day or next day). Simple, polite:

“Hi [Name], thank you again for taking the time to chat earlier. I learned a lot about [insert something specific they said]. I really appreciate your insights!”
