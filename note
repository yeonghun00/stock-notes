Dear Mr. Kim,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Evan (Yeonghun), a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking, with about 20 days remaining in my internship.

I’m eager to learn more about Financial Markets before I finish, and your role in Equity Derivatives stood out to me — especially as someone interested in how data supports decision-making in a fast-paced trading environment.

I completely understand you must be very busy, but if you're open to it, I’d be very grateful for a brief 15-minute conversation, either in person or virtually. I’m based in the same building in Hong Kong and flexible with timing.

If your schedule doesn’t allow, I’d also appreciate any recommendations of colleagues I could reach out to. I'm also happy to chat in Korean, if that’s more comfortable.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Evan (Yeonghun)
Data Analytics Intern
Commercial Banking, HSBC Hong Kong

Dear Ms. Moon,

I hope you're doing well.

My name is Evan (Yeonghun), a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking. I have about 20 days left in my internship, and before I finish, I’m hoping to gain a broader understanding of how different areas of HSBC operate.

Your role in Collateral Treasury caught my attention, especially given my interest in how financial resources and risks are managed within the bank.

I completely understand you have a busy schedule, but if you’re open to it, I’d be truly grateful for a brief 15-minute conversation — in person or virtual, whichever is more convenient for you. I’m based in the same building in Hong Kong and flexible with timing.

If your schedule is full, I’d also really appreciate any recommendation of colleagues who might be open to a quick chat.

Thank you so much for considering this.

Best regards,
Evan (Yeonghun)
Data Analytics Intern
Commercial Banking, HSBC Hong Kong
