Hi Tae Youl,

I’m Evan (Yeonghun), currently interning in Commercial Banking as a Data Analytics Intern. I have about 20 days left, and before I finish, I’m hoping to learn more about other areas of HSBC, especially in the financial markets.

Your role in Equity Derivatives caught my attention — coming from a data background, I’m very curious how analytics supports trading decisions in such a fast-paced environment.

If you're open to a quick 15-minute chat (in person or virtual — whichever is easier), I’d really appreciate it. I’m in the same building and very flexible with timing.

Also, if you're more comfortable speaking in Korean, I'm happy to do that too. And if your schedule is full, I’d really appreciate any recommendations of someone else I might speak with.

Thanks again for your time,
Evan (Yeonghun)
Data Analytics Intern




Hi Selina,

I’m Evan (Yeonghun), a Data Analytics Intern in Commercial Banking. I’ve got about 20 days left in my internship, and before I wrap up, I’d love to learn more about different areas of the bank.

Your role in Collateral Treasury really stood out to me, especially given my interest in how financial resources and risks are managed at HSBC.

If you're open to a quick 15-minute chat (in person or virtual — whichever is easier), I’d really appreciate it. I’m in the same building and very flexible with timing.

Also, if you're more comfortable speaking in Korean, I'm happy to do that too. And if your schedule is full, I’d really appreciate any recommendations of someone else I might speak with.

Thanks so much for considering,
