his is an excellent initiative for an intern! Your approach demonstrates a solid understanding of statistical methods and a proactive attitude. As a critical statistician, I will dissect your plan to identify potential weaknesses and suggest improvements, aiming to make your analysis more robust and your presentation truly impactful.

Here are my critical points, broken down by your proposed sections:

General Critical Points & Overarching Concerns:
"Tariff Date: 2025/04/02": Given that today is June 3, 2025, a tariff date of April 2, 2025, means you have actual post-tariff data. This is a huge advantage and should be emphasized. Many analyses have to rely on expected or simulated impacts. Your ability to analyze real post-event data is a significant strength.
Definition of "Net Buy": Be absolutely explicit about how you define "Net Buy." Is it (Total Buy Amount - Total Sell Amount) or (Number of Buy Trades - Number of Sell Trades)? For investment behavior, the amount is usually more insightful. Ensure consistency.
Causality vs. Correlation: This is the biggest statistical hurdle. While you're investigating the impact of the tariff, establishing a direct causal link is difficult. Your "difference-in-differences" approach is the strongest statistical tool for this, but acknowledge potential confounding factors.
Data Granularity: You have trade-level data. Will you aggregate this by customer, by day, by security type, or by industry for your analyses? Be clear about your aggregation strategy, as it impacts the unit of analysis for your tests. For example, if you run a T-test on "Net Buy Change," is each data point a customer's net buy, or a day's net buy? Customer-level aggregation is likely more insightful for behavioral changes.
Presentation Narrative: Beyond the statistical rigor, your presentation needs a compelling story. Start with the "why" – why is this tariff important? What business question are you trying to answer? Conclude with actionable insights for the RMs.
Critical Review of Your Approach:
1. Net Buy Change (T-test)
Weakness: A simple t-test comparing average net buy before vs. after per customer might be too simplistic.
Unit of Analysis: What is the "sample" for your t-test? Is it the net buy of all customers before vs. after? Or the change in net buy for each customer? The latter, paired t-test or a t-test on the differences, is more appropriate if you are comparing the same customers.
Baseline Fluctuations: Investment behavior is inherently volatile. A simple before-after comparison might pick up general market movements or other concurrent events, not just the tariff.
Recommendation for Robustness:
Paired T-test or Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test: If you analyze the change in net buy per customer, a paired t-test (if assumptions met) or its non-parametric equivalent (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) would be more appropriate. This directly assesses if the individual customer's net buy changed significantly.
Focus on Active Customers: Consider defining "active" customers (e.g., those who traded in both periods) for this analysis to avoid diluting the signal with inactive accounts.
Log Transformation/Normalization: Investment amounts often follow skewed distributions. Consider log transforming the amount or using non-parametric tests if the normality assumption for the t-test is violated.
Relative Change: Instead of absolute change, consider the percentage change in net buy, especially if customer investment sizes vary widely. This can normalize the impact.
2. Net Buy Change by Security Types (Chi-square (Contingency Table))
Weakness: Chi-square for "net buy change" for continuous data (amount of money) is generally not appropriate. Chi-square tests are for categorical data (counts, proportions). You're dealing with continuous values (amounts).
Misapplication of Chi-square: A contingency table would typically be used for something like "proportion of customers who increased net buy in Security Type A vs. Security Type B." You're interested in the amount.
Recommendation for Robustness:
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) or Kruskal-Wallis Test: If you want to compare the average net buy change across different security types, ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric) would be suitable.
ANOVA: If you categorize "change" (e.g., "Increased Net Buy," "Decreased Net Buy," "No Change") and count customers in each category per security type, then a Chi-square on those counts might be acceptable, but it loses the magnitude of the change.
Individual T-tests/Wilcoxon Tests per Security Type: Conduct separate paired t-tests (or Wilcoxon) for net buy change for each security type. This would tell you if, say, "net buy of bonds" changed significantly.
Regression Analysis: More advanced, but you could model net buy as a function of the tariff indicator, security type, and their interaction. This would directly tell you if the tariff's effect differs across security types.
Visualization: Stacked bar charts showing the total net buy (or average net buy per customer) for each security type before and after the tariff will be highly impactful visually, even if the statistical test is more complex.
3. Industry Impact (T-test)
Weakness: Similar to point 1, what is the unit of analysis for the t-test? Comparing the average net buy change across industries would require something like ANOVA.
Recommendation for Robustness:
ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis: If you want to see if the average net buy change differs significantly between industries, ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis is appropriate.
Individual T-tests/Wilcoxon Tests per Industry: Perform paired t-tests (or Wilcoxon) for net buy change within each major industry. This tells you which specific industries saw a significant change.
Top N Industries: Focus on the top N industries by customer count or trading volume for meaningful analysis, especially if you have many small industries.
Qualitative Insight: Beyond the statistical test, think about why certain industries might be more impacted. Does the tariff disproportionately affect their business models or investment strategies? This adds depth.
4. Seasonal Control (Difference-in-Differences)
Strength: This is your strongest statistical approach and demonstrates sophistication. Excellent choice!
Weakness for your data:
"Since I have data 2023~2025, I cannot see seasonal factor.": This statement is contradictory. Having data from 2023-2025 allows you to see seasonal factors. You have two full years of historical data (2023, 2024) and partial 2025. This is perfect for identifying seasonality.
Control Group: What is your control group for difference-in-differences? Ideally, it should be a group not affected by the tariff but otherwise similar to your affected group. This is difficult in banking unless you can define a specific segment of customers who were exempted or only indirectly impacted. If the tariff applies to all customers, your control group will have to be a "synthetic control" (using pre-tariff data) or external market data if available.
Your Proposed Control: Comparing 2025 (pre/post tariff) with 2024 (same periods) is a valid "quasi-control" for seasonality. This assumes no other major interventions between 2024 and 2025 besides the tariff that would differentially affect customer behavior in those specific periods.
Recommendation for Robustness:
Explicitly Define Groups and Time Periods:
Treatment Group (T): Your customers in 2025.
Control Group (C): Your customers in 2024 (or a defined subset).
Pre-Period (P1): e.g., 2025/03/02 - 2025/04/01 (30 days before tariff)
Post-Period (P2): e.g., 2025/04/02 - 2025/05/01 (30 days after tariff)
Control Pre-Period (C1): e.g., 2024/03/02 - 2024/04/01
Control Post-Period (C2): e.g., 2024/04/02 - 2024/05/01
The Calculation:
(Avg_NetBuy 
T,P2
​
 −Avg_NetBuy 
T,P1
​
 )−(Avg_NetBuy 
C,C2
​
 −Avg_NetBuy 
C,C1
​
 )
A positive (or negative) significant difference here would indicate an effect beyond normal seasonality.
Regression-based DiD: For more rigor, a regression model is preferred: Y=β 
0
​
 +β 
1
​
 ⋅Post+β 
2
​
 ⋅Treated+β 
3
​
 ⋅(Post×Treated)+ϵ Where:
Y = Net Buy (or log Net Buy per customer)
Post = 1 if post-tariff period, 0 if pre-tariff period.
Treated = 1 if current year (2025), 0 if control year (2024).
β 
3
​
  is your difference-in-differences estimator, representing the tariff's causal effect. This allows you to control for other customer-level characteristics if you include them.
Visualizing DiD: Plotting the average net buy for both 2024 and 2025 over time, with a vertical line at the tariff date, can visually illustrate the parallel trends assumption and the divergence after the tariff.
Additional Points for Impression:
Hypothesis Formulation: For each statistical test, clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses. This demonstrates academic rigor.
Example for Net Buy Change:
H 
0
​
 : There is no significant change in average customer net buy after the tariff.
H 
1
​
 : There is a significant change in average customer net buy after the tariff.
Assumptions & Limitations: Be upfront about the assumptions of your statistical tests (e.g., normality for t-tests, independence of observations). If assumptions are violated, briefly mention what you did (e.g., used non-parametric test, log-transformed). Acknowledge limitations of your data (e.g., short post-tariff window, limited control variables). This shows critical thinking.
"30 days" window: Critically evaluate if 30 days is sufficient for "behavior change." Some changes might be immediate, others might take longer to manifest. You could mention this as a limitation and suggest future analysis with more post-tariff data.
Practical Significance vs. Statistical Significance: A statistically significant result might not be practically significant for the business. For example, a $10 increase in net buy might be significant but trivial. Always translate your findings into business implications. "While statistically significant, the impact on average bond trading was only X%..."
Data Quality/Missing Data: Briefly mention how you handled any missing data or outliers. This shows attention to detail.
Actionable Insights: This is paramount for RMs. What does your analysis tell them?
"Customers in the Tech industry are showing a significant drop in foreign stock purchases post-tariff. RMs for these clients should be alerted to understand their new preferences or potential disengagement."
"The tariff appears to have shifted investment from local stocks to bonds. RMs should be trained to advise clients on diversified bond portfolios."
Future Work: Conclude with suggestions for further analysis. This demonstrates foresight and a desire to contribute long-term.
Longer-term impact analysis.
Deep dive into specific high-impact customer segments.
Segmentation based on pre-tariff behavior (e.g., high-frequency traders vs. long-term investors).
By addressing these critical points, you will transform your good plan into a robust, insightful, and highly impressive presentation that showcases not just your statistical skills but also your critical thinking and business acumen. Good luck!





so net buy

I have data of table format. each row is amount of money bought or sell. if buy is positive value else negative value.



So aggregation part, the total trade (rows) are about 400000 for 2023~2025. which is ... large enough or is it small?? i was trying to aggregate into day so it looks like time series.



is this bad approach??



so if i am to make dummy table, it would look like





# Generate date rangestart_date = '2023-01-01'end_date = '2025-05-29'dates = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='B') # Business days only# Key eventstrump_date = pd.Timestamp('2025-01-20')apr_event = pd.Timestamp('2025-04-02')# Customer and security setupn_customers = 500customers = [f'Customer_{i:03d}' for i in range(n_customers)]industries = ['Technology', 'Manufacturing', 'Finance', 'Retail', 'Healthcare', 'Energy', 'Real Estate', 'Consumer Goods']security_types = ['Foreign Stocks', 'Local Stocks', 'Bonds', 'Certificate of Deposit', 'Unit Trusts', 'ETFs']# Generate tradestrades = []for date in dates: # Adjust trading patterns based on events if date >= trump_date: foreign_bias = 0.3 # Reduced foreign investment volume_multiplier = 1.2 # Increased trading volume else: foreign_bias = 0.5 volume_multiplier = 1.0 # Daily trades (varying by day) n_trades = np.random.poisson(200 * volume_multiplier) for _ in range(n_trades): customer = np.random.choice(customers) industry = np.random.choice(industries) # Bias security selection based on period if date >= trump_date: security_probs = [foreign_bias, 1-foreign_bias, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05] else: security_probs = [0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.05, 0.03, 0.02] security_probs = np.array(security_probs) / sum(security_probs) security_type = np.random.choice(security_types, p=security_probs) # Generate trade details investment = np.random.choice(['Buy', 'Sell'], p=[0.55, 0.45]) amount = np.random.lognormal(10, 1.5) * 1000 # Log-normal distribution for amounts trades.append({ 'Date': date, 'Customer_Name': customer, 'Customer_Industry': industry, 'Investment': investment, 'Amount': amount, 'Security_Type': security_type })# Create DataFramedf = pd.DataFrame(trades)





based on this, please provide robust appraoch i should do



Your clarification regarding the Amount column (positive for buy, negative for sell) is crucial and simplifies the "Net Buy" calculation significantly – it's simply the sum of these amounts. This is an excellent way to structure your data.

Now, let's critically evaluate your aggregation strategy ("aggregate into day so it looks like time series") and refine your approach for robustness.

Critical Evaluation of Daily Aggregation for Net Buy
Your idea of aggregating to daily net buy to create a time series is not inherently bad, but it's suboptimal for drawing robust conclusions about customer behavior change.

Weaknesses of Daily Aggregation for Your Goal:

Loss of Customer-Level Granularity: When you aggregate to daily net buy, you lose the individual customer's journey and behavioral shifts. Your goal is to help RMs make insights and good decisions, and RMs interact with customers, not with the overall market's daily net buy. A significant daily dip could be due to a few large institutional trades rather than a widespread change in individual customer behavior.
Increased Noise: Daily trading data is inherently noisy. A few large trades on a given day can heavily skew the daily net buy, making it harder to discern underlying trends or the tariff's specific impact on typical customer behavior.
Difficulty in Attributing Change: If daily net buy drops, is it because fewer customers are buying, or existing customers are buying less, or existing customers are selling more? Daily aggregation masks these distinctions.
Statistical Test Validity: While you could run time series analyses, the number of "data points" for your t-tests or ANOVA would become the number of days, not the number of customers. This is less intuitive for measuring customer impact.
Your 400,000 Rows - Is it Large or Small?

For trade-level data: 400,000 rows over ~2.5 years (2023-2025) is a decent volume. It implies an average of around 400-500 trades per business day.
For customer-level analysis: If you have 500 customers (as in your dummy data), 400,000 trades means an average of 800 trades per customer over 2.5 years, or about 320 trades per customer per year. This is a very active customer base, which is good for analysis as it provides sufficient data per customer.
Conclusion on Daily Aggregation: While useful for high-level dashboards, it's not the primary level of aggregation for understanding customer investment behavior change due to a tariff.

Robust Approach: Prioritizing Customer-Level Analysis with Time Series Context
The most robust approach will focus on customer-level aggregation while still leveraging your time-series data for the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework.

Your Core Unit of Analysis Should Be the Customer.

Here's how to structure your analysis for maximum impact and statistical validity:

Data Preparation & Aggregation (Crucial First Step)
Define Time Periods:

Pre-Tariff Period: e.g., 30 days before Tariff Date (2025/03/03 to 2025/04/01). Let's call this P 
pre,2025
​
 .
Post-Tariff Period: e.g., 30 days after Tariff Date (2025/04/02 to 2025/05/01). Let's call this P 
post,2025
​
 .
Control Pre-Period (2024): Corresponding 30 days in 2024 (2024/03/03 to 2024/04/01). Let's call this P 
pre,2024
​
 .
Control Post-Period (2024): Corresponding 30 days in 2024 (2024/04/02 to 2024/05/01). Let's call this P 
post,2024
​
 .
Self-Correction: You have data up to 2025/05/29. This is more than 30 days post-tariff. You can choose to analyze the full available post-tariff period (up to 2025/05/29) or stick to a symmetrical 30-day window for direct comparison. For a 7-10 min presentation, consistency (e.g., 30-day windows) is often clearer, but mention you have more data for future analysis.
Calculate Customer-Level Net Buy for Each Period:
For each active customer (defined as a customer who made at least one trade in any of the four defined periods):

NetBuy_Pre_2025: Sum of Amount for Customer X in P 
pre,2025
​
 .
NetBuy_Post_2025: Sum of Amount for Customer X in P 
post,2025
​
 .
NetBuy_Pre_2024: Sum of Amount for Customer X in P 
pre,2024
​
 .
NetBuy_Post_2024: Sum of Amount for Customer X in P 
post,2024
​
 .
Self-Correction: What about customers who only trade in one period? If a customer had 0 net buy in a period, that 0 is a valid observation. Ensure you track all customers present in at least one of the 4 periods.

Customer-Level Changes:

Change_2025 = NetBuy_Post_2025 - NetBuy_Pre_2025
Change_2024 = NetBuy_Post_2024 - NetBuy_Pre_2024
This gives you a dataset where each row is a Customer_Name, and you have their net buy amounts (or changes) for each of the four periods. This is your foundation.

Robust Analysis Steps (Revisiting Your Plan)
1. Overall Net Buy Change (Difference-in-Differences for Robustness)
Statistical Approach: Perform a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis on Net Buy.
Hypotheses:
H 
0
​
 : The tariff had no additional impact on customer net buy beyond normal seasonal fluctuations.
H 
1
​
 : The tariff had a significant additional impact on customer net buy beyond normal seasonal fluctuations.
Execution:
Calculation: (Avg(NetBuy 
Post,2025
​
 )−Avg(NetBuy 
Pre,2025
​
 ))−(Avg(NetBuy 
Post,2024
​
 )−Avg(NetBuy 
Pre,2024
​
 ))
Statistical Test:
Option A (Simpler, Good for Presentation): Use a t-test to compare Change_2025 to Change_2024. This directly tests if the change in 2025 was significantly different from the change in 2024.
Option B (More Rigorous - Regression): Construct a regression model: NetBuy ~ Beta_0 + Beta_1*Post_Indicator + Beta_2*Year_2025_Indicator + Beta_3*(Post_Indicator * Year_2025_Indicator) + error
NetBuy is the customer's net buy for that specific period (you'd need to reshape your data so each customer-period combination is a row).
Post_Indicator: 1 if it's a post-tariff period (P2025, P2024), 0 if pre-tariff (P12025, P12024).
Year_2025_Indicator: 1 if it's 2025 data, 0 if 2024 data.
Beta_3 is your DiD coefficient. A significant β 
3
​
  suggests a causal effect.
Consider Log Transformation: If net buy amounts are highly skewed (which is likely), analyze log(abs(NetBuy) + 1) or use non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon rank-sum if assumptions for t-tests are not met. Zeroes are common, so log(abs(NetBuy)+1) handles them. Alternatively, if your concern is direction of change, consider analyzing proportions.
2. Net Buy Change by Security Types
Statistical Approach: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis (Non-parametric ANOVA).
Aggregation: For each customer, for each of the four periods, calculate NetBuy_SecurityType_X.
Then, for each customer, calculate Change_2025_SecurityType_X = NetBuy_Post_2025_SecurityType_X - NetBuy_Pre_2025_SecurityType_X.
And Change_2024_SecurityType_X = NetBuy_Post_2024_SecurityType_X - NetBuy_Pre_2024_SecurityType_X.
Execution:
Focus on specific changes: For each Security_Type (Foreign Stocks, Local Stocks, Bonds, etc.), conduct a separate DiD analysis (as in point 1). This tells you if the tariff had a significant impact on net buy for that specific security type.
Compare across security types (if applicable): If you want to see if the magnitude of the tariff's impact differs significantly across security types, you could run an ANOVA on the (Change_2025 - Change_2024) values, with Security_Type as a grouping variable. This is more advanced and might make your presentation too complex.
Insight: This will help identify which investment products were most affected.
3. Industry Impact
Statistical Approach: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis.
Aggregation: Group customers by Customer_Industry.
Execution:
For each Customer_Industry, conduct a DiD analysis (as in point 1). This identifies which industries experienced a significant tariff-related change in their overall net buy.
Alternatively, use a regression-based DiD model where you interact the Post_Indicator * Year_2025_Indicator term with Customer_Industry dummy variables. This allows you to test for differential impacts across industries directly within one model.
Insight: Pinpoint industries where RMs need to pay special attention due to the tariff's unique impact.
4. Seasonal Control (Integrated into 1, 2, and 3 via DiD)
Your Difference-in-Differences approach is precisely how you control for seasonality and general market trends. By comparing the "change in change" between the tariff year and the control year, you isolate the specific impact of the tariff. This is not a separate step, but the core methodological improvement applied to steps 1, 2, and 3.

Visualizations to Impress
For each analysis, visualize the results clearly.

Overall Net Buy: A time series plot showing the average daily/weekly net buy for 2024 and 2025. Mark the tariff date. The "divergence" post-tariff is your key visual evidence for DiD.
Security Types: Side-by-side bar charts showing "Average Net Buy Pre-Tariff" vs. "Average Net Buy Post-Tariff" for each security type, comparing 2025 vs. 2024. Or, simply bar charts of the Change_2025 - Change_2024 for each security type.
Industry Impact: Similar bar charts for industries, showing the DiD impact.
Addressing the "Dummy Data" and Practical Considerations
Your Dummy Data: Your dummy data generation script is excellent for simulating the type of data you have. It correctly includes time, customer, industry, trade type, and amount.
Data Cleaning: In a real scenario, you'd need to:
Handle potential data errors (e.g., negative amounts for buys, positive for sells, if your current schema was different).
Handle outliers (e.g., extremely large one-off trades) – decide whether to cap them or run robust regressions.
Ensure consistent Customer_Name and Customer_Industry mapping.
"Active Customers": Define what constitutes an "active" customer for each analysis. For net buy changes, you might only consider customers who traded in both the pre and post periods of a given year, or at least in one of the 4 periods as I suggested earlier. Just be clear about your definition.
Statistical Software: You'll likely use Python (Pandas for aggregation, SciPy.stats or Statsmodels for tests) or R for this.
By focusing on customer-level analysis and rigorously applying Difference-in-Differences, you will deliver a statistically robust, highly interpretable, and manager-impressing presentation. Good luck!
