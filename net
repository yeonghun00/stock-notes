"Hi William,
I'm Evan Lee, a data analytics intern at HSBC finishing up soon. I noticed you work in Equity Portfolio TDG and was really interested in learning about portfolio management and trading desk analytics.
I've been working on equity analysis projects (built a stock screener with 20+ years of US data) and have experience with risk modeling through my FRM Part 1 studies. Would you have 10 minutes sometime to share your insights about working in equity portfolios?

Would you be available for a brief chat sometime next week? If you're too busy but know someone else who might be willing to share their experience, I'd be grateful for an introduction as well.

Thanks for considering it!
Evan Lee
Data Analytics Intern"


"Hi Sebastien,
I'm Evan Lee, a data analytics intern at HSBC wrapping up in a couple weeks. I noticed you work in Equity Derivatives Structuring, which combines exactly what I'm passionate about - quantitative modeling and derivatives.
I have experience with Python optimization, financial modeling, and derivatives pricing concepts from my FRM studies. Would you be available for a brief 10-minute chat about your path into structuring and what the role involves day-to-day?

Would you be available for a brief chat sometime next week? If you're too busy but know someone else who might be willing to share their experience, I'd be grateful for an introduction as well.

Thanks for considering it!
