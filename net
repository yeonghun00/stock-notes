Hi Jin,
Thank you so much for your quick response!
I should have been clearer in my initial message - I'm actually not available today (Tuesday). I apologize for the confusion.
Would any of these times work better for you?

Wednesday: Any time except 4-5 PM
Thursday: Any time
Friday: Any time

I'm completely flexible within those windows and happy to work around your schedule.
Thanks again for your willingness to meet!
Best regards,
