Hi Jin,

[CC: Asia Hub team]

Thank you for your response, and I apologize for not including the Asia Hub team initially - I should have been more aware of the proper protocol.

Tomorrow (Wednesday) at Pacific Room on 20F works perfectly for me. Could you please let me know what time would be convenient for you?

I really appreciate you taking the time to meet, and I look forward to our conversation.

Best regards,
Evan

This way you:

Acknowledge the protocol issue
Confirm the location
Ask for the specific time
Show you're being proactive about scheduling
Don't just show up or wait for him to email tomorrow - that could create confusion or make you seem unprepared. Always confirm meeting times clearly in professional settings.
